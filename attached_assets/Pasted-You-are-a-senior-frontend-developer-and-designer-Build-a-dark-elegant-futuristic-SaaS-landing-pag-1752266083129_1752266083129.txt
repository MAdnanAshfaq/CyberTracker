You are a senior frontend developer and designer. Build a dark, elegant, futuristic SaaS landing page for a cybersecurity platform called **TraceIntel**. Use React and TailwindCSS. 

🎯 Design Inspiration:
Recreate the landing page layout and style based on the design of the app "Cobalt" (see screenshot provided). Follow its sections, fonts, structure, and color palette closely — deep navy backgrounds, glowing gradients, clean sans-serif typography, bold headlines, sharp icons, modern graphs, and well-padded sections.

📄 Landing Page Sections:

1. **Hero Section**
- Headline: “Track with precision. Investigate with confidence.”
- Subheadline: "TraceIntel helps you track, trace, and visualize potential threats, fraudsters, and digital intrusions with pinpoint geolocation and device intel."
- Primary CTA: “Join the Beta” button
- Secondary CTA: “See How It Works”
- Background: animated star grid or subtle dark gradient
- Responsive layout with full-screen width

2. **Interactive Dashboard Preview**
- Mock image of the TraceIntel dashboard (placeholder or component screenshot)
- Label sections like “Insights”, “Traces”, “Location Map”
- Display a live chart or placeholder chart to simulate interactivity

3. **Feature Sections (3 columns)**
- Feature #1: “Intelligence at Your Fingertips” — access precise device metadata instantly.
- Feature #2: “Real-time Geolocation” — get user-permitted GPS-level tracking when links are clicked.
- Feature #3: “Legal + Ethical” — trace within licensed boundaries with user consent.

4. **App Integrations Grid**
- Title: “Connect with your stack”
- Show dummy logos (e.g., Discord, Slack, Email, Notion, Stripe) to imply integrations
- Grid style, minimal glowing hover effects

5. **AI Assistant Section (Like ‘Meet Genius’)**
- Headline: “Meet TraceAI”
- Subtext: “Your built-in AI analyst for link activity, location movement patterns, and anomaly detection.”
- Add a fake chat interface or simple interaction mockup (input + suggestions)

6. **CTA Footer**
- Title: “Ready to Trace Smarter?”
- Button: “Join the Beta” or “Get Started”
- Add privacy policy + terms footer below

🛠️ Tech Stack:
- React + TailwindCSS
- Use responsive layout via Tailwind grid/flex
- Use `react-icons` or SVGs for section icons
- Include placeholder images or components where mockups are needed
- No backend functionality yet — static content and interactive feel only

🎨 Tailwind Theming Tips:
- Use `bg-gradient-to-b from-[#0d1117] via-[#0f172a] to-[#1e293b]`
- Text: slate-100, slate-400
- Buttons: glassmorphism / glowing borders
- Headline Font: use `font-extrabold text-5xl md:text-6xl`
- Add light animation to background stars or grid (optional)

📦 Output Requirements:
- One-page responsive React layout
- Beautiful scrollable dark theme
- Modern typography and spacing
- Tailwind-based responsiveness
- Clean code organization in `components` folder (Hero.jsx, Features.jsx, Footer.jsx, etc.)

Now begin designing the full landing page. Start with `LandingPage.jsx` and import all components. Do not add database or auth yet — this is a pure marketing-facing first impression page.
